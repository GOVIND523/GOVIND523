@ 🙋‍♂️ Hiii ! 😀 I am Govind a computer engineer🧑‍💻 because I know how a computer functions and how to make best👌 use of the machine.

@ 🖥️ As every computer science student I also am going through my academics📖 pretty great actually and also trying to hit some off shores 
    in order to sharpen my weapon [🧠]. After learning programming languages like Java, C, C++, Python and web development stuff and Flutter 
    the open-source UI software development kit by Google. I am currently floating on the surface of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the basics
    of deep neural networks and machine learning algorithms as of ( 02 - 2023 ).
    
@ 🎆 Apart from tech I am also a good friend and always open to expanding that network of mine. I also find finance, management and politics 
    interesting and am always willing to know more about it which are always great for small talks. Design are what fascinates me the most and
    I always want a element of it in my life as for my internship as a UI/UX Designer.
